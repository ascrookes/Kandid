Kandid (intended name)
======

Problem?
Whenever someone takes a picture, they are left out of the moment. People also want to capture the important moments in their lives, but this leads people to living life behind their camera to capture these moments.

Solution?
Kandid is an attempt to capture some of the  picturesque moments in our life without leaving anyone out of the picture. Whenever someone takes a picture they are left out of the moment. By leaving an iPhone somewhere that it has sight of the room, it can become the photographer of all those moments. Kandid attempts to do so by tracking volume changes in the room and capturing a photo when there is a certain change in that volume.

Philosophy?
The philosophy behind this project is fundamentally wrong. A shift in volume in a room does not signify an important moment. With this philosophy baked into the app, although it does capture some good moments, it takes a lot of random photos. The downside of sorting through and deleting these random photos far outweights the positive of getting a few good pictures.

Other Problems?
This approach is incredibly battery draining. Having the camera on, audio recording, and audio processing is a lot of work to be done on a mobile device.

Future?
Hopefully with a new philosophy this app could provide huge amounts of value to many people's day to day lives. Also having a way to do so that does not kill the battery so fast will also help.
